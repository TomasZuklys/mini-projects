# SOAP WS Bottom Up (Spring 4 + Apache CXF)

SOAP WS using Spring 4 and Apache CXF - Bottom Up approach when you are building WS from scratch directly in JAVA and don't want or have no knowledge how to create WSDL file manually.
This approach is more common as it allows creating SOAP web service faster and easier.
The main thing that most developers used to overlook is how the generated WSDL looks like. You need to use different additional annotations to make it more elegant.
 
This project uses Spring annotation based configuration (No XML).
